<h1>Classifying the assets connected to a home network</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved identifying and categorizing all devices connected to a home network to enhance security and manageability. The assets were classified based on their type (e.g., computers, smartphones, IoT devices), manufacturer, and operating system. This classification helped in understanding the network's landscape, identifying potential vulnerabilities, and applying appropriate security measures. By organizing the assets into categories, the project aimed to streamline network management and ensure all devices adhered to security policies.
